                    In a quaint village nestled amidst rolling hills and lush greenery, lived a boy named Romli. His days were filled with the simplicity of rural life, where the rhythm of nature dictated the passage of time. Romli’s world was small but familiar, a place where everyone knew each other and life moved at a gentle pace.
                    However, fate had different plans for Romli. One fateful day, news arrived that would change his life forever. Romli was to leave his beloved village and move to the bustling city. The city, with its towering buildings, endless noise, and unfamiliar faces, was a world Romli had only heard about in stories.
                    As he prepared to embark on this new journey, Romli couldn’t help but feel a mix of excitement and trepidation. The city promised opportunities and adventures, but it also posed challenges that Romli had never faced before. With a heart full of hope and a mind brimming with questions, Romli set off, ready to embrace the unknown and discover what lay beyond the horizon.
